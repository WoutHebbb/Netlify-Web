                    I got an assignment with 2 co-students to come up with an idea to notify organizations for food that will spoil soon.
                    It was hard to think of a way to notify the organizations without changing too much for the employees. With that in mind 
                    we looked for a way to use their current database system 'Unicenta'. We had the idea to make a new table in the database 
                    and link it to the existing table with all the products. Our new table will contain the name, price, quantity and expire
                    date. When the expire date is in sight, we will send an automated mail to the organizations to notify them.<br>
                    All this was build with the Laravel Framework 'Homestead'. This way there would be a website to inform all day long. A small
                    extra we would have liked to add was a way for the employees to check the expire date on the spot. This would be possible with 
                    a smartphone and QR codes. But we had no time left to test this.<br><br>
                    The planning of this project was with a teacher playing as our client. We asked him the primary/secondary requirements, 
                    the total (hypothetical) cost and more. We had several meetings with him to get all the information we needed for this project.

                        This was an individual project for the course DevOps & Security. We got to choose between 3 projects and I chose the project 
                        where I could work with Microsoft Server.
                      </p>
                      <p>What was the assignment? We started from a little story. There was a new company called Aperture, they needed help with their Windows 
                        Server. They wanted some security on Internet Explorer, some programs installed on specific computers and their  
                        company logo as wallpaper. I had to automate this, so I didn't need to repeat all these steps for every computer or 
                        new employee. I Also made some groups to give or deny permission on certain shared files. If you don't need the file, 
                        you can't see the file.
                      </p>
                      <p>I made some new Organization units for every department. For example:</p>
                      <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                        <li>1 OU for the Cosmetics Management</li>
                        <li>1 OU for the Cosmetics regular employee</li>
                        <li>1 OU for the Personal Care Management</li>
                        <li>1 OU for the Personal Care regular employee</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>After I created all the OU's I started making the Group Policies. These Groups Policies needed to install the necessary 
                        software and change the wallpaper of the computers.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                       For this project, we needed to make a smart parking place with a lot of sensors and a web interface, all from a Raspberry Pi. 
                       This 'smart parking place' had a barrier with a sensor and a camera. This sensor checked if there was a car in front 
                       of the barrier and if there was a car and a free spot in the parking place, the barrier would open and a picture was 
                       taken of the license plate to put it on the web interface. But how did it know if there was a free spot? Every 
                       parking spot had a light sensor. If the sensor was dark (in a shadow), the parking spot is taken.<br>
                       All this information was show visually on a web interface. A LCD screen on the entrance showed if there was a free spot.
                       Here is everything we used:
                       <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                         <li>1 Raspberry Pi</li>
                         <li>1 ultrasoon sensor</li>
                         <li>1 LCD screen</li>
                         <li>1 USB camera</li>
                         <li>4 LDR sensors</li>
                       </ul>
                       Now we have our equipment, we can start building it. We all started on a different part, so we could bring it all 
                       together in the end. So what did I do?<br>
                      </p>
                      
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 content pt-3"><p>
                      I worked on the LCD screen and helped with the reading of the license plate. The LCD screen would only show 
                      if the parking spot was free or taken. After I did that, I helped with reading out the license plates. This was difficult, but 
                      then we found a useful library to use.<br>
                      The hardest part of this project was bringing everything together. It took us almost 3 days from 15:30 till 19:00. But we 
                      made it work and I am very happy with the result.<br>
                      We have filmed a demo you can watch here or by clicking on the picture.</p>

                    We had to simulate our own hosting platform for websites for different clients. The basics we needed for this task were
                    that it can run PHP and MySQL websites and that it had a transfer method. Because it needs to be 
                    secure, we chose to go with SFTP. To keep the project free we used a VPN connection to access the 
                    website, the website would only be accesseble via the VPN. This VPN connection was also used to 
                    connect to our remote datacenter, where we use VSphere. You can get a view of what we want to create 
                    from the image. This image was created after our research, this way we have a visual way 
                    to help us remind what we were building.
                  </p>
                  <p>Because I was elected as the scrum master, I kept track of everybody's assignment. But that was not the only thing 
                    I did.
                  </p>
                  <p>I was responsible for the monitoring of all our servers. I chose to do this with Zabbix, this is a free but premium 
                    monitoring system. First of all, I needed to install the Zabbix Server package on my server. This has a SQL database and 
                    an Apache webpage. This is for holding all the data it will collect. The webpage is for the GUI webpage. This is the place where
                    I would configure everything.<br>
                    To collect data from the servers, I wrote a script to install the Zabbix Agent and modify the configuration file.
                    I encrypted the connection with a Pre-shared-Key.
                    Some of the data I collect are:

                <p>I would first collect data to create a baseline. This way I could check how it normally is. 
                  That way, I would know when something is off. After I had created a baseline, I created some 
                  triggers. These triggers will notify me when something is off.</p>
                <p>
                  After the monitoring was done I wanted to automate a back-up of the essential stuff. I used rdiff to create a zip file with all
                  the essential stuff from all the servers. These were stored on a different server for a quick reboot and on Google Drive for a 
                  separate server in case of a natural disaster. I did this with a python script that takes copies the files to a zip and removes 
                  the zip after an amount of time.<br>
                  Everything from this file is documented, so we could create it again if we wanted to.

                  This project combines all the speciality courses from the IT Factory at Thomas More Geel. There were 2 students from each 
                  course.

                <p>We had to make a monitoring system based on sound for a customer Mediaan. Because you can't see everything, but 
                  you can hear a lot more. Because this is such a big project I will focus on the parts I did with my colleague 
                  CCS student. This customer had a few requirements for us:
                  for us.

                  This made us already think of a few things. What database will we use? How will we host everything on Azure? What 
                  services will we use? How will we build everything in 30 minutes? Luckily, Mediaan already gave us 
                  the idea to work with Bicep to build everything. For the other stuff we did our own research.<br>
                  We first decided to do research to the necesarry stuff: The database and the web app.<br>
                  All the Databases on Azure are SQL based. This meant we decided on the price and the winner was 
                  MariaDB. After telling the APP students, they told us they rather have MySQL. So we switched to 
                  MySQL on Azure. For the web app, we decided to host the front-end on the 'Static Web App' and the 
                  back-end on the 'App Service'. The AI student requested a service to visualize their data. 
                  So we started doing research in Grafana. After a while, we decided to get the service up and running. 
                  Now that we have the basics, the App students could start on pushing their progress to production.<br>
                  Now we started to look at automatic building with Bicep and Azure Pipeline. It took us a while but, 
                  we managed to do it with a mix of Bicep and Powershell CMDlets.<br>
                  We are a course focussed on Cloud & Cybersecurity. So to keep everything safe, we kept all the 
                  sensitive data in Azure Vault. We also wanted to implement Azure Defender. But this would bring us 
                  over the budget. So we told them about it but, didn't implement it.<br>
                  At the end we had to present our result to the customer. They are very happy with the result.

              <h3>Non-technical stuff</h3>
              <p>
                IT is technical but the non-technical stuff, like planning or the workflow, are as important as the 
                technical knowledge<br>
                That is why we had daily meetings with our team.<br>
                We worked with a scrum board to keep track of our work. Every sprint we would clean the board with the 
                finished steps. 1 sprint was 1 week.
              </p>
              <p>We are very proud of our result. I am so proud I wanted to share it with the world via a
